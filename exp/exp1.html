    <h2>Open the console to see the functionality of the code!</h2>

        /* This script prints all the numbers from the range 1 to 100, except when the number is divisble by 3 it prints out "Fizz" and when it's divisible by 5 (and not 3) it prints out "Buzz." 
        
        This works by using a for loop to go through all the numbers from 1 to 100, then for each number it goes through the if else statements that analyzes if the number is divisible by the 3 or 5.*/

    
        for (var i = 1; i <= 100; i++) { /* for loop starts here */
            if (i % 3 == 0){  /* if else statement - selection starts here */
                console.log('Fizz');
            } 
            else if (i % 5 == 0){  /* sequence where because I put i%3 first it puts 'Fizz' when it gets to numbers both divisible by 3 and 5 instead of 'Buzz' */
                console.log('Buzz');
            } else {
                console.log(i);
            }
