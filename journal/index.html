        <p>Juan and I shared our images with each other. His photo features an underexposed film image of a waterfall in Iceland. The image itself is very complex; I believe that it could invite people to think visually. The inclusion of the beautiful waterfall may make people wonder about its location. The square sprockets on the sides of the image that indicate that this image was taken on film give more personality to the image. Rather than a plain image, there are more aspects for people to ponder on. In particular, the fact that the image is underdeveloped gives it a mysterious and interesting feeling. Questions may arise about the reasoning behind it and why the designer chose this image, giving rise to more discussion.</p>

        <p>Juan commented that he wanted to do his design on the theme of the fragmentation of memories. While the state of the images as underdeveloped already works towards that theme, I think that adding filters to change the alter the image even more could add the theme as well. By utilizing different filters on the images, it could represent the different perspectives others could have on those same images. The images will also feel less ordinary if he can change the text on the images to play with the same idea of different perspectives.</p>

        <p>For my images, I chose the picture of my grandmother sewing. By looking at this image without context, one may think that it's just a regular image without a story. But that's not the case; instead, the image is a reference picture for the painting that was created. I like to think that the image gives a glimpse into my mind as a photographer, and especially, my mind as a painter. This image and all of the other ones I will be using tell the story of my thought process and provide a glimpse into how I connect real-life images with the narrative of my paintings. As I believe that the images themselves are already compelling, I look forward to exploring ways to showcase my theme through the use of animations and transitions on the image itself. </p>

            <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/27/10-intriguing-photographs-to-teach-close-reading-and-visual-thinking-skills/">Original Article Link</a>

        <p>Visual thinking is not a new concept to me. I was lucky enough to learn the skill way before starting my design major. I had to visually think through the lens of a photographer and painter during my high school years. Thinking about the composition of an image, and what emotions or message you want that image to convey is a crucial aspect in building that visual thinking for others. I used my images to then create paintings that also had to have an intriguing story or visual. The key point is that visual thinking creates complexity and engagement; it's the foundation of how we see and understand the world around us.</p>

        <p>The article “10 Intriguing Photographs to Teach Close Reading and Visual Thinking Skills” by Michael Gonchar dives deeper into how others can develop this skill. Visual thinking is a part of our critical thinking ability. As creatives, it's important to understand the underlying mechanics of this skill in order to create visuals that have an impact or effect on others. I especially love that the article mentions the need to slow down and look around us; sometimes being able to observe is the way to start visually thinking.</p>

        <p>A great example of a website that promotes visual thinking is <a href="https://ponpon-mania.com/">Ponpon Mania</a>, which showcases the adventures of Ponpon the sheep through colorful and strong graphics, and a variety of interactivity. This site includes many animations of graphics that draws the user in and makes them wonder more about Ponpon and what adventures he goes on. This site is one of the coolest ones I've seen; its interactivity pulls you in and makes you want to explore the story and concept even further. Such novel ways to present information is the cornerstone of promoting visual thinking. The only setback I see for this site is the potential for cognitive overload from the amount of animations of images; this is something I'll keep in mind for my own project.</p>

        <p>Learning more tips about overlay design could have not come at a better time! These tips will not only help me in creating my MadLib design, but they will also aid me in other projects I'm participating in. The article "Best Practices for Modals / Overlays / Dialog Windows" by Naema Baskanderi consists of great explanations of considerations design should take into account when creating overlays.</p>
        <p>I appreciated the article's emphasis on ensuring that modals provide a good user experience. Tips like providing clear indicators and context (e.g. making sure the button label and title matches), and suggesting accessibility considerations (e.g. putting keyboard focus on the modal) exemplifies this emphasis.</p>
        <p>As someone who has done research on modals in the past (and might've gone through this exact article at some point), I find the article's layout and concise explanations really helpful in providing a refresher on the best practices. </p>

                <h2>Form Design</h2>
                <time datetime="2025-10-11">October 11, 2025</time>
            </div>
            <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">Original Article Link</a>
        </div>
        <p>Form design is a practice I've never thought about as much as I should, considering how important forms are for conversion. The article “Best practices for form design” by Salim Ansari does a wonderful job of articulating tips designers should consider when designing forms.</p>

        <p>The main concepts I took away from the article is the importance of preventing cognitive overload and providing for ease of use. Forms are meant to be easy to complete, and by adding extra bells and whistles (too many input fields, too many questions without proper sectioning, etc.), users can easily get overwhelmed; consequently they are less likely to want to complete the form. In addition, designers also have to take into account clarification and ease of understanding. A form itself should be intuitive, users should be able to complete one without too much confusion; proper labeling, correct size for fields, placeholder text and providing necessary keyboards all help make forms easier to use and more efficient.</p>

        <p>A good example of a well-designed form is the <a href=https://www.dmv.ca.gov/wasapp/vrir/start.do?localeName=en>CA DMV Vehicle Registration Renewal Form</a>. The form exemplifies the best practices for forms by having clear labels for each input field, explanation/instructions for more complicated fields, and good accessibility via proper contrast and text size control. Although the user of placeholder text is done incorrectly, this mistake is made up for by the clear hint given in the labeling.</p>

        <p>As I design future forms, like the MadLib one for this class, these tips will help tremendously in creating a design that provides a good experience for users. I realized that in the past, while I already knew some of the tips, I did infer much of my other knowledge without considering if they were correct; this article helped to correct those assumptions. The article's conciseness and clarity makes it a great resource for designers.</p>
