        <p>Learning more tips about overlay design could have not come at a better time! These tips will not only help me in creating my MadLib design, but they will also aid me in other projects I'm participating in. The article "Best Practices for Modals / Overlays / Dialog Windows" by Naema Baskanderi consists of great explanations of considerations design should take into account when creating overlays.</p>
        <p>I appreciated the article's emphasis on ensuring that modals provide a good user experience. Tips like providing clear indicators and context (e.g. making sure the button label and title matches), and suggesting accessibility considerations (e.g. putting keyboard focus on the modal) exemplifies this emphasis.</p>
        <p>As someone who has done research on modals in the past (and might've gone through this exact article at some point), I find the article's layout and concise explanations really helpful in providing a refresher on the best practices. </p>

                <h2>Form Design</h2>

        <p>Form design is a practice I've never thought about as much as I should, considering how important forms are for conversion. The article “Best practices for form design” by Salim Ansari does a wonderful job of articulating tips designers should consider when designing forms.</p>

        <p>The main concepts I took away from the article is the importance of preventing cognitive overload and providing for ease of use. Forms are meant to be easy to complete, and by adding extra bells and whistles (too many input fields, too many questions without proper sectioning, etc.), users can easily get overwhelmed; consequently they are less likely to want to complete the form. In addition, designers also have to take into account clarification and ease of understanding. A form itself should be intuitive, users should be able to complete one without too much confusion; proper labeling, correct size for fields, placeholder text and providing necessary keyboards all help make forms easier to use and more efficient.</p>

        <p>A good example of a well-designed form is the <a href=https://www.dmv.ca.gov/wasapp/vrir/start.do?localeName=en>CA DMV Vehicle Registration Renewal Form</a>. The form exemplifies the best practices for forms by having clear labels for each input field, explanation/instructions for more complicated fields, and good accessibility via proper contrast and text size control. Although the user of placeholder text is done incorrectly, this mistake is made up for by the clear hint given in the labeling.</p>

        <p>As I design future forms, like the MadLib one for this class, these tips will help tremendously in creating a design that provides a good experience for users. I realized that in the past, while I already knew some of the tips, I did infer much of my other knowledge without considering if they were correct; this article helped to correct those assumptions. The article's conciseness and clarity makes it a great resource for designers.</p>
